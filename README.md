Hello.
I can show you an example of your request.
You should provide more details about your project, such as:

1) Where does the script extract data after the "="?
2) Does it only extract one piece of data per line or more?
3) The output label is formatted for the first part of the line (before the "="), or is related to the file name, or a user-defined name.
etc.
